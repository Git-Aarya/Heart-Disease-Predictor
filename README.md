# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Heart disease is a major health issue worldwide, and it is difficult to discover the disease before symptoms emerge. Our goal of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques and predict whether or not a person has heart disease. This will be done through our dataset, which is derived from the Cleveland Heart Disease Database and consists of 14 important attributes selected from a total of 76. It encompasses a range of variables including physical and psychological details, such as age, sex, cholesterol, etc. It also categorizes individuals based on the absence (value 0) or presence (values 1-4) of heart disease, providing a clear framework for analyzing the predictive power of medical test results.

## Methods
We are going to do the following:
- Mutate the data to make sure categorical variables are treated as factors.
- Change the variable names to more descriptive and human-readable.
- Use k-nearest neighbors regression algorithm to predict the likeliness of a person having a heart disease using key health indicators.
- Scale the data in order to standardize the data.
- Use a bar plot to visualize how certain attributes affect the likelihood of having heart disease.

## Data Visualization
To gain insights into the dataset and uncover potential relationships, we will implement various visualization techniques:
- Scatter plots to explore relationships between different health indicators.
- Stacked bar plots to observe the distribution of categorical variables across different outcomes.
- Box plots to review the variation and distribution of key health metrics across categories.

These visualizations aim to uncover hidden patterns and correlations in the data, assisting in the development of our predictive model.

## Expected Outcomes and Significance
**What do you expect to find?**
After this project, we expect to identify certain health indicators that correlate positively with the likelihood of heart diseases.

**What impact could such findings have?**
These insights could enable early detection of heart disease symptoms, allowing for timely intervention and potentially saving lives.

**What future questions could this lead to?**
This approach might be applicable to other diseases, leading to broader research into predictive health analytics.
